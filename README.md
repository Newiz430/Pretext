# Node features

<details open>
    <summary>Node features</summary>

## Feature prediction

* Feature prediction: to predict the original node features by decoding low-dimensional representations
* Feature denoising: to add (generally continuous, e.g. isotropic Gaussian) noises to the original features and try to reconstruct them
* Masked feature prediction: a special, discrete case of feature denoising, which predicts the original features of masked nodes by representations of unmasked ones. It is "autoregressive" if the predicted nodes are generated one-by-one
* Replaced node prediction: to replace some nodes with different ones and learn to find and reconstruct the replaced nodes

<sup>1</sup>For language models. To randomly mask a set of node tokens and try to reconstruct them

## Discrimination (contrastive)

* Latent feature matching: to minimize the (Euclidean) distance between pairs of positive representation vectors
* Instance discrimination: to minimize/maximize the distance between pairs of positive/negative representation samples. Jenson-Shannon (JS), InfoNCE (incl. NT-Xent), Triplet margin, and Bootstrapping are all estimators of mutual information (MI) between nodes. Other contrastive losses:
  * SP stands for the [population spectral contrastive loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04156)
  * BPR stands for Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss, mostly used in recommendation
  * Other stands for other, literally not belonging to any of the above
* Dimension discrimination: to minimize/maximize the mutual information (MI) between pairs of positive/negative representation dimensions. Could be either intra-sample or inter-sample

* Property prediction: a regression task to predict the property of a node (e.g. degree)
* Centrality ranking: to estimate whether the centrality score of a node is greater/lower than that of another node
* Node order matching: to match the output node order with the input order

* Link prediction: a generally binary classification task that predicts if two nodes are connected by a link. For heterogeneous graphs, link prediction is based on meta-paths. For hypergraphs, link prediction searchs for the missing node given other nodes in a hyperedge
* Link denoising: to add (generally continuous) noises to the original edge set and try to reconstruct it
* Masked link prediction: to predict the masked links by node representations propagated on the unmasked graph. It is "autoregressive" if the predicted links are generated one-by-one
* (Masked) edge feature prediction: to predict the original (masked) edge features by node representations
* Replaced edge feature prediction: to replace some edge properties with different ones and learn to find and reconstruct the replaced edges, similar to replaced node prediction

* Context discrimination: to distinguish between contextual nodes and non-contextual nodes. LE stands for Laplacian Eigenmaps objective
* Contextual subgraph discrimination: to distinguish between representations aggregated from different contextual subgraphs (maybe from different receptive fields). CE stands for cross-entropy
* Context feature prediction: node feature prediction but to reconstruct the features of k-hop neighbors instead
* Contextual property prediction: to predict the properties of contextual subgraphs (e.g. node / edge types contained, total node / edge counts, structural coefficient)

* Similarity prediction: to predict a similarity matrix between nodes. The pairwise similarity can be defined by shortest path distance, PageRank similarity, Katz index, Jaccard coefficient, $\ell_2$ distance & cosine similarity between output representations / input-output, etc
* Similarity-based discrimination: instance discrimination that is node similarity-aware
* Similarity graph alignment: to construct an additional similarity graph based on pairwise similarities of node features or graph topology, and minimize the distance of representation distributions between them (the original and similarity graph, or two different similarity graphs)

* Global-local instance discrimination: instance discrimination between the representation of each node and a global representation vector, usually aggregated from the whole graph by a readout function
* Group discrimination: a simplified global-local instance discrimination that binarily classifies if a node belongs to the original or the perturbed graph
* Global instance discrimination: to discriminate between global representations of different graph views (generally for small-scale graphs)
* Global dimension discrimination: dimension discrimination of different graph representations
* Graph similarity prediction: to predict various kinds of similarity functions between pairs of graphs, e.g. graph kernels (graphlet kernel, random walk kernel, graph edit distance kernel, etc)
* Half-graph matching: to divide each graph into two halves and predict if two halves are from the same original graph

* Cross-manifold discrimination: to perform instance discrimination between different manifolds (e.g. Euclidean vs. Hyperbolic)
* Ricci curvature prediction: to predict the aggregated Ricci curvature of each node's neighborhood
* Curvature-based node clustering: to assign each node a cluster centroid and maximize/minimize the curvature-based density within/across clusters
* Hyperbolic angle prediction: to pool representations to 2-dimensional angle vectors in a unit hyperbola. These vectors serve as pseudo-labels for regression

# Task generalization strategies

<details open>
    <summary>Task generalization strategies</summary>

* Multi-task learning: to combine different pretexts (or graph model parameters) and jointly learn them for task-generalizable performance (technically not a task generalization strategy, and is compatible with other task generalization strategies)
* Fine-tuning: to jointly learn downstream branches as well as the original pre-trained model. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) only updates part of the pre-trained model, e.g. adapter layers
* Prompting: to jointly encode downstream data and extra learnable task-specific components to instruct the behavior of pre-trained models for downstream generalization
* Mixture-of-Experts: to select different experts in the original network for different tasks without fine-tuning
