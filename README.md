# Node features

<details open>
    <summary>Node features</summary>

## Feature prediction

* Feature prediction: to predict the original node features by decoding low-dimensional representations
* Feature denoising: to add (generally continuous, e.g. isotropic Gaussian) noises to the original features and try to reconstruct them
* Masked feature prediction: a special, discrete case of feature denoising, which predicts the original features of masked nodes by representations of unmasked ones. It is "autoregressive" if the predicted nodes are generated one-by-one
* Feature recovery: to predict the original node features by the trivial synthetic features

## Discrimination (contrastive)

* Latent feature matching: to minimize the (Euclidean) distance between pairs of positive representation vectors
* Instance discrimination: to minimize/maximize the distance between pairs of positive/negative representation samples. Jenson-Shannon (JS), InfoNCE, Bootstrapping, and Triplet margin are all estimators of mutual information (MI) between nodes. BPR stands for Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss
* Dimension discrimination: to minimize/maximize the mutual information (MI) between pairs of positive/negative representation dimensions. Could be either intra-sample or inter-sample

* Link prediction: a generally binary classification task that predicts if two nodes are connected by a link
* Link denoising: to add (generally continuous) noises to the original edge set and try to reconstruct it
* Masked link prediction: to predict the masked links by node representations propagated on the unmasked graph. It is "autoregressive" if the predicted links are generated one-by-one
* Meta-path prediction: link prediction on heterogeneous graphs, to predict if two nodes are connected by a meta-path
* (Masked) edge feature prediction: to predict the original (masked) edge features by node representations

    <summary>Context</summary>

* Context discrimination: to distinguish between contextual nodes and non-contextual nodes (LE stands for Laplacian Eigenmaps objective)
* Factorized context discrimination: to maximize the log-likelihood of context representations given the corresponding central node conditioned on multiple disentangled latent factors
* Contextual subgraph discrimination: to distinguish between representations aggregated from different contextual subgraphs (maybe from different receptive fields)
* Neighbor feature prediction: node feature prediction but to reconstruct the features of k-hop neighbors instead (BPR stands for Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss)
* Contextual property prediction: to predict the properties of contextual subgraphs

* Similarity prediction: to predict a similarity matrix between nodes. The pairwise similarity can be defined by shortest path distance, PageRank, Katz index, Jaccard coefficient, $\ell_2$ distance & cosine similarity between output representations / input-output, etc
* Masked path prediction: similar to masked link prediction, but the links are masked in paths
* Similarity-based discrimination: instance discrimination that is node similarity-aware
* Similarity graph alignment: to construct an additional similarity graph based on pairwise similarities of node features or graph topology, and minimize the distance of representation distributions between them (the original and similarity graph, or two different similarity graphs)

* Motif prediction: to assign each node (or supernode in the fragment graph) a motif pseudo-label given by unsupervised motif discovery algorithms (e.g. RDKit) and learn to predict them. It is "autoregressive" if the predicted supernodes are generated one-by-one
* Motif-based masked feature prediction: similar to masked feature prediction, but the features are masked in motifs
* Motif-based discrimination: to perform contrast between the original graph view and the fragment graph view
* Motif adversarial generation: to generate motifs with an adversarial min-max optimizer

* Synthetic graph discrimination: binary classification between two synthetic graphs with different synthesizers (Erdős-Rényi generator / SBM generator)
* Node clustering: to assign each node a cluster centroid (prototype) and - i) minimize the distance between nodes and their corresponding centroids in the latent space; or ii) minimize the distance between the learned centroids and the ground-truth centroids given by unsupervised feature clustering algorithms (e.g. K-means, DeepCluster)
* Graph partitioning: to assign each node a cluster centroid (prototype) and - i) predict the quality of the learned partitions evaluated by some metrics, e.g. maximizing modularity or minimizing the normalized edge weights of a graph cut (spectral clustering); or ii) predict the cluster membership of each node given by unsupervised graph partitioning algorithms (structure-based, e.g. METIS, Louvain)
* Cluster/partition-based instance discrimination: instance discrimination that is aware of graph clustering/partitioning memberships
* Cluster/partition-conditioned link prediction: to maximize the log-likelihood of existing links, but conditioned by the graph cluster/partition distributions
* Partition-conditioned masked link prediction: similar to masked link prediction, but the links are masked in clusters

* Global-local instance discrimination: instance discrimination between the representation of each node and a global representation vector, usually aggregated from the whole graph by a readout function
* Group discrimination: a simplified global-local instance discrimination that binarily classifies if a node belongs to the original or the perturbed graph
* Global instance discrimination: to discriminate between global representations of different graph views (small-scale only)
* Global dimension discrimination: dimension discrimination of different graph representations
* Factorized global instance discrimination: to maximize the log-likelihood of the target graph instance given the corresponding instance conditioned on multiple disentangled latent factors
* Graph kernel prediction: to predict various kinds of kernels between pairs of graphs: graphlet kernel, random walk kernel, graph edit distance kernel, etc
* Half-graph matching: to divide each graph into two halves and predict if two halves are from the same original graph

* Cross-manifold discrimination: to perform instance discrimination between different manifolds (e.g. Euclidean vs. Hyperbolic)
* Ricci curvature prediction: to predict the aggregated Ricci curvature of each node's neighborhood
* Curvature-based node clustering: to assign each node a cluster centroid and maximize/minimize the curvature-based density within/across clusters
* Hyperbolic angle prediction: to pool representations to 2-dimensional angle vectors in a unit hyperbola. These vectors serve as pseudo-labels for regression

# Task adaptation strategies

<details open>
    <summary>Task adaptation strategies</summary>

* Multi-task learning: to combine different pretexts and jointly learn them for task-generalizable performance
* Fine-tuning: to jointly learn downstream branches as well as the original pre-trained model. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) only updates part of the pre-trained model, e.g. adapter layers
* Probing: to freeze the parameters of the pre-trained model during the downstream task adaptation. The probe can be either parameterized or non-parameterized
* Prompting: to encode downstream data and the corresponding task information as tokens to instruct the behavior of pre-trained models for downstream adaptation
