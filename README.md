# What To Learn? A Survey On Pretext Tasks for Graph Self-Supervised Learning

This is a extensive and continuously updated compilation of graph SSL literature categorized by the knowledge-based taxonomy, proposed by our paper "[What To Learn? A Survey On Pretext Tasks for Graph Self-Supervised Learning]()". Here every pretext and the adapted downstream tasks of each paper are listed and briefly explained. You can find all the sub-tasks and their corresponding papers along with their PDF and source code links in the sections below, as well as additional pretexts and literature not detailed in our paper. The aim of this list is to assist in designing new self-supervised graph pretexts for better SSL performance on GNNs, graph transformers, LLM-based graph foundation models, and more graph learning frameworks.

# Node features

<details close>
    <summary>Node features</summary>

## Feature prediction

* Feature prediction: to predict the original node features by decoding low-dimensional representations
* Masked feature prediction: to predict the original features of masked nodes by representations of unmasked ones. It is "autoregressive" if the predicted nodes are generated one-by-one
* Feature recovery: to predict the original node features by the trivial synthetic features

## Discrimination (contrastive)

* Latent feature matching: to minimize the (Euclidean) distance between pairs of positive representation vectors
* Mutual information maximization: to minimize/maximize the mutual information (MI) between pairs of positive/negative representation samples. There are four estimators of MI: Jenson-Shannon (JS), InfoNCE, Bootstrapping, and Triplet margin
* Factor discrimination: to maximize the log-likelihood of the target instance given the corresponding instance conditioned on multiple disentangled latent factors
* Dimension discrimination: to minimize/maximize the mutual information (MI) between pairs of positive/negative representation dimensions. Could be either intra-sample or inter-sample

* Link prediction: a generally binary classification task that predicts if two nodes are connected by a link
* Masked link prediction: to predict the masked links by node representations propagated on the unmasked graph. It is "autoregressive" if the predicted links are generated one-by-one
* Meta-path prediction: link prediction on heterogeneous graphs, to predict if two nodes are connected by a meta-path
* (Masked) edge feature prediction: to predict the original (masked) edge features by node representations

* Context discrimination: to distinguish between contextual nodes and non-contextual nodes (LE stands for Laplacian Eigenmaps objective)
* Factorized context discrimination: to maximize the log-likelihood of context representations given the corresponding central node conditioned on multiple disentangled latent factors
* Contextual subgraph discrimination: to distinguish between representations aggregated from different contextual subgraphs (maybe from different receptive fields)
* Neighbor feature prediction: node feature prediction but to reconstruct the features of $k$-hop neighbors instead
* Contextual property prediction: to predict the properties of contextual subgraphs

    <summary>Long-range similarities</summary>

* Similarity prediction: to predict a similarity matrix between nodes. The pairwise similarity can be defined by shortest path distance, PageRank, Katz index, Jaccard coefficient, cosine similarity of node representations, etc
* Masked path prediction: similar to masked link prediction, but the link are masked in paths
* Similarity-based discrimination: instance discrimination that is node similarity-aware
* Feature graph alignment: to construct a feature graph based on pairwise similarities of node features and minimize the distance of representation distributions between the original graph and the feature graph

* Motif prediction: to assign each node (or supernode in the fragment graph) a motif pseudo-label given by unsupervised motif discovery algorithms (e.g. RDKit) and learn to predict them. It is "autoregressive" if the predicted supernodes are generated one-by-one
* Motif-based masked feature prediction: similar to masked feature prediction, but the features are masked in motifs
* Motif-based discrimination: to perform contrast between the original graph view and the fragment graph view

    <summary>Global structure</summary>

* Global-local instance discrimination: instance discrimination between the representation of each node and a global representation vector, usually aggregated from the whole graph by a readout function
* Group discrimination: a simplified global-local instance discrimination that binarily classifies if a node belongs to the original or the perturbed graph
* Graph kernel prediction: to predict various kinds of kernels between pairs of graphs: graphlet kernel, random walk kernel, graph edit distance kernel, etc

# Manifolds

    <summary>Manifolds</summary>

* Cross-manifold discrimination: to perform instance discrimination between different manifolds (e.g. Euclidean vs. Hyperbolic)
* Ricci curvature prediction: to predict the aggregated Ricci curvature of each node's neighborhood
* Curvature-based node clustering: to assign each node a cluster centroid and maximize/minimize the curvature-based density within/across clusters
* Hyperbolic angle prediction: to pool representations to 2-dimensional angle vectors in a unit hyperbola. These vectors serve as pseudo-labels for regression

# Task adaptation strategies

<details close>
    <summary>Task adaptation strategies</summary>

* Multi-task learning: to combine different pretexts and jointly learn them for task generalizable performance
* Fine-tuning: to jointly learn the downstream branches as well as the original pre-trained model
* Probing: to freeze the parameters of the pre-trained model during downstream task adaptation
* Prompting: to encode downstream data and the corresponding task information as tokens to instruct the behavior of pre-trained models for downstream adaptation (more information [here](https://github.com/WxxShirley/Awesome-Graph-Prompt))
